Direct Messaging
================

TODO
----

* proximity scores and single sends
* fluent interface
* show stack in debug mode
* write space invaders
  * can i use a message to find out if an object has an overlap with another?
    - what would we illuminate?
    - maybe just draw a different outline? (could be yellow like the beam)
  * get it running in production mode
  * then tweak debug mode until it's helpful and nice for this example
* try out an example that's not inherently visual
